    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <strong>2026-01-01</strong></p>

    <div class="card">
      <p><strong>Summary (plain English):</strong> FluentWeave does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data from the app. The app has no accounts, no analytics, and no third-party SDKs. If you contact us by email, we’ll receive your email and message so we can respond.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the FluentWeave mobile app and the FluentWeave website.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>App:</strong> We do not collect personal information from the FluentWeave app. The app does not transmit your personal data to us or to third parties.</li>
      <li><strong>On-device data:</strong> The app may store reading progress and preferences <em>locally on your device</em> to provide core functionality. This information stays on your device and is not sent to us.</li>
      <li><strong>Website:</strong> We do not intentionally collect personal information through this website other than what you choose to send us (for example, by email).</li>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> If you email us, we receive your email address and message content so we can respond.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect (App)</h2>
    <p>The FluentWeave app does not collect or request access to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Contacts</li>
      <li>Photos, media library, or camera data</li>
      <li>Health data</li>
      <li>Payment information</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
      <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
      <li>Crash reporting via third-party SDKs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not track you. FluentWeave does not use data for cross-app or cross-site tracking, and does not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email/support:</strong> To respond to inquiries and provide support.</li>
      <li><strong>On-device functionality:</strong> Reading progress and preferences stored on-device are used only to operate the app on your device.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal:</strong> To comply with legal obligations if applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not share personal information from the app because we do not collect it. We may share information only if required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p><strong>App:</strong> Because the app does not collect data from you, we do not retain app data on our servers. Any reading progress or preferences are stored locally on your device.</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> We retain email communications only as long as needed to respond and keep basic business records.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect communications we receive (such as emails). Note that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Encryption / Export Compliance Note</h2>
    <p>FluentWeave does not implement custom encryption. Like most apps, it may rely on standard, platform-provided security features (for example, Apple’s built-in networking security) when communicating over the internet.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>FluentWeave is intended for a general audience, with a primary focus on adult learners. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we add features that collect or transmit personal information (for example, accounts, analytics, or third-party SDKs), we will update this Privacy Policy before those changes take effect.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@fluentweave.com">hello@fluentweave.com</a>.</p>
